# junomidi
Sends multiple slide potentiometer input to a Roland Alpha Juno 2 through MIDI and SysEx using an Arduino (Mega 2560).

Currently set up to handle 16 faders (as this is the max capacity of an Arduino Mega without muxing) set up to modify the Juno 2 with parameters similar to the Juno 106.

You can easily change which parameters are modified by the faders by changing the array or adding a new page to the array.
